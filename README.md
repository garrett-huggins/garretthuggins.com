Personal website for hosting resume and blog. _v 2.0_

Hello! I'm Garrett, a frontend developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. I enjoy building websites using modern frameworks and spending too many hours reading docs.

## Behind The Scenes
garretthuggins.com was bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`

Here is a list of everything I used to create this site:
- Nextjs / Reactjs
- Typescript
- TailwindCSS
- MDX
- Framer-motion
